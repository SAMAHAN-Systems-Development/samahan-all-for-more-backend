4. Install the libraries with this command:

```bash
npm i
```

5. Install and create the docker containers with this command (make sure that you already started your docker application):

```

Note the `service role key` and set the value of `supabase_key` in your .env file to the value of the service role key.

4. Run the NestJS backend
